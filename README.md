# play-scala-angularjs

This is a bootstrap for building projects using Play 2.x (w/ Scala) and all frontend controlled with AngularJS. 

Also in the frontend, for managing web dependencies this template uses RequireJS. As layout template it is 
using some Bootstrap minimal template and other few libraries linking Bootstrap and AngularJS.

In the persistence layer this template considers using MongoDB, but the dependency is there only to make sure
the example core compiles and run.
