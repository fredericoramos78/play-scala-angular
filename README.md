# play-scala-angularjs

This is a bootstrap for building projects using Play 2.x (w/ Scala) and all frontend controlled with Angular2. So all frontend components, like html files, CSS and Javascript controllers and logic is placed under "ui/" directory, which is managed by Angular2 and Webpack. The backend side of the application should be coded in Scala, using the Play! structure of <code>Controllers</code> and serviced as WS-like APIs so that the frontend logic can call them.

There is no layout template applyed here, so you can decide to add Bootstrap or Material2.



Powered by Play! 2.6 and Scala 0.13.15.
